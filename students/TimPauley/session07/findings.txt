Findings 

After refactoring the code from lesson 5 so now the it returns two tuples and the following fields:

1. record count in the database prior to running
2. record count after running
3. time taken to run the module
4. number of records processed

Using timeit my parallel.py file runs quicker than my linear.py. Therefore, the parallel.py program is superior program.

Alll my tests passed in Pytest.
