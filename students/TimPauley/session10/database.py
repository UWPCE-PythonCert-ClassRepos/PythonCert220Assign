'''
Your program, called database.py, must output details of timing for 
all functions in the program. Gather this data and write it to a file 
called timings.txt. The file should contain function name, time taken
, and number of records processed, and be called timing.csv.

Be sure to demonstrate how the timing changes with differing number 
of records (you can copy and duplicate the data provided in the 
lesson 5 csv files so you have more data to deal with. Itâ€™s easy to 
do that. Be sure to show widely different numbers of records). Make 
some notes on your conclusions.
