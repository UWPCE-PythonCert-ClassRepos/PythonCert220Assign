# Lesson 10 Assignment - Conclusions

I used metaclassing to add timing information for each function in the HP Norton database.
The results were written to timings.csv.  Unfortunately, I did not find any significant bottlenecks.

I ran the program using 10 records each for products, customers, and rentals.
Importing the csv file and adding bulk data was slightly faster for products, but customers and rentals didn't take very long at all.
Overall, importing all the data took .50 seconds.  Showing available products takes .001 seconds and showing the rentals for one product takes .002 seconds.
Clearing the database took .22 seconds, which I thought was kind of surprising.  Luckily, we shouldn't need to do that during production.

I also ran the program using 10,000 records each for products, customers, and rentals.
Importing the csv file for rentals (.13 seconds) took a little bit longer than products and customers (.11 seconds each).
However, adding bulk data for products (1.54 seconds) took a little bit longer than customers (1.14 seconds) and rentals (1.08 seconds).
Overall, importing all the data took 3.91 seconds, which is pretty good compared to the time it took to upload 10 records each.
Showing available products takes .15 seconds and showing the rentals for one product takes .15 seconds.  It probably just takes longer since there are more records in the database now.
Clearing the database took .32 seconds, which is also pretty good compared to the first run.
